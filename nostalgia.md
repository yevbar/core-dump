> Y: I was wondering if you had an article around the topic of nostalgia? It seems like there is a sufficient amount of positive valence gained with it :slightly_smiling_face:

> A: Ahh, Nostalgia is a tricky one. It is true that it comes with positive valence at times, and sometimes it enables deep existential feelings. It's like you wrap your mind in a blanket that allows it to contemplate depressive realism without being depressed. A sleight of hand, because you think you are introspecting on something sad, yet what is emphasized is precisly the best and most enduring aspects of something gone, i.e. your positive memories of it.
I know that nostalgia is used as a counter-example to David Pearce. But it is such a corner case! The vast majority of depressed feelings are very awful, and people don't produce great work when they are depressed (due to lack of motivation). Light nostalgia is not even close to being truly sad.

> A: Probably best source would be Pearce's "objection" page:
4.11 "I sometimes like being sad; it's an experience I wouldn't wish to lose."
An agreeable, wistful melancholy, a haunting lullaby nostagically recalled from childhood, or perhaps the bitter-sweet memory of a long-lost love, are certainly preferable to the hell of unmitigated depression. Yet all too many types of experiences are unambiguously dreadful. They have no redeeming features at all. They don't issue in great works of art, literature and scholarship etc. They would be far better abolished. All the positive aspects of the more complex and ambivalent states one may undergo can in future be magnified and sharpened; nothing enjoyable need be lost. But the negative undercurrents which still diminish the value and enjoyment of more perceptibly composite states can be chemically subtracted out.

> A: I.e. let's figure out "what is good in nostalgia" and amplify it while removing the negative components. It's like masochism - it turns out that people don't enjoy pain, but the pleasure that rituatlized submission can cause. If you show a masochist a way to get **that feeling** without the body discomfort, they would prefer it over what they currently do to get it.

> Y: Re the "good in nostalgia" - could it be that nostalgia is a flow state?
In the present moment, you're thinking back to the moment(s) that the nostalgiac inducer brings about. However, in this flashback (if you mentally visualize the moments)/emotion, time is irrelevant since you're getting the same valence (valence vector?) both then and now, which fits the "timeless" description of flow. Depending on the extent of the nostalgia (ie how long ago the experience was, how many occurences of a song can you rememer), you can also get the complexity in the flow state.
Following this is obviously the question about how a negative experience then can be a positive experience now and the answer to that would be that, in the present moment, there's almost an amour fati appreciation for that occurance and how it brought you to now.
When people remember depressive thoughts of experience negative flashbacks without means of acceptance/appreciation, then Pearce's bit about art applies for artists that create art out of enjoyment. But there are sure to be artists that create art out of hatred/negative emotions?

> A: Very interesting observations about nostalgia. I like the idea of comparing it to flow.
The truth is that yes, some art would be impossible without negative states. On the other hand, what the value of such art? There is voyeuristic interest ("good it isn't me!"). There is also relatedness ("finally someone I can related to because they lived through the same hell I did"). And there is knowledge ("glad they documented these experiences because they are useful scientifically and philosophically to understand ourselves better").
But in each case there is a better way. If you are in a great state you don't need to see worse states to make you feel better about the present one. If you are happy you don't need sad art to feel like someone can relate to you. And if you want the scientific account, you can go do experiments directly and get the data in a clean way rather than through the filters and layers of the artist.
But yes, I conced there is art that is unique that couldn't exist without negative states. Just don't think it is something we will **miss** very much when are all happy.
