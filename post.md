Why isn't anyone pointing out that Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke wasn't just an ordinary member of the Cult of the Dead Cow -- he claimed to have been present when it was founded, and to have come up with the name? http://textfiles.com/groups/CDC/cDc-0079.txt

This bit from his interview with a neo-Nazi also seems ripe for political haymaking: http://textfiles.com/groups/CDC/cDc-0059.txt

"We do not support Neo-Nazism in any way; however, we also do not
believe in censorship. Therefore, for the Aryan bible and more information
on the Church of Jesus Christ, write to:

Feel free to write a friendly message, or send them a 'special' package.
Surely they'd appreciate some 'fan' mail...."
