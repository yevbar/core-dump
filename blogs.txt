Worth checking out (though I infrequently monitor):

Ray Dalio's Bridgewater
MIRI intelligent agents foundation
LessWrong, Effective Altruism forums

also blogs for Github, Stack Exchange [not as much], Gmail, Dropbox, and other "tech that most people tend to use"

i'd want some more bioengineering but quality control/figuring out what's relevant is often harder to people in these b/c they dont know everything

look at nathaniel brooks horwitz for biotech stuff.

once upon a time i read scienceblogs stuff. also chem blogs (there are two i once read a lot that i dont read as much anymore). also sean carroll.
